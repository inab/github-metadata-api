This repository contains an API that can be used to extract metadata from a GitHub repository and update the metadata of a GitHub repository. The API is designed to be used in the context of the [FAIRsoft Evaluator](https://openebench.bsc.es/observatory/Evaluation). The API is used by the [Metadata Extractor for FAIRsoft]() and the [Metadata Updater for FAIRsoft]() applications. The API can be also used using a user access token to perform the same functions.

This API is a Node.js application that uses Express.js as the web framework. The API uses the GitHub API to extract and update metadata of a GitHub repository. The API uses the [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit) library to interact with the GitHub API.
